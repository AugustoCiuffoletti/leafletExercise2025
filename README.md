# Step 1: a map

This is a step by step tutorial on leaflet that will guide you to the imlmentation of a functional web app. To follow the mini tutorial you are invited to follow this [link](https://stackblitz.com/edit/dhss2021). There you find the IDE to browse and modify the code, and the README files that illustrate the step by step progression.

The first step simply consists in showing a map.

The result is obtained by adding a *div* element into the HTML file where the map will appear. The links to the leaflet library and to a specific CSS
file are also added.

The *index.js* contains one call to the library (*L* is the name for *leaflet* in the code). The *map* method displays a map in the defined div element. The commad takes options to define the initial center of the map and the zoom scale, together with the source for the raster.

Once the map is on display you can drag and zoom in/out using the mouse.

Tp experiment, go to the *map* documentation and try some of the other (many) options available.

Next select the *popup* branch to move to the next step.
