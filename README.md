# Step 9: save your data to the cloud storage

We need to identify a service fitting our needs. In essence, we need to store in the cloud an array of data, the coordinates of the markers.

Since the data structure is of limited size and complexity, we opt for a very simple KVaaS (key-value as a service), which allows to store a single string associated to a URL (the key). The string may be quite long, up to a MByte. To implement our cloud store we will pack the array of coordinates in a single JSON string.

The service we are going to use is available at https://keyvalue.xyz/, where you find the ten-lines-long documentatin for the service. With a POST request to a well known URL you obtain the personal URL that serves as a key to access your storage. With a POST to the personal URL you upload your string, with a GET you download it.

The curl command line utility is useful to produce GET and POST requests from the commandline. It is of immediate installation on any Operating System, and the command to obtain a personal URL is

curl -X POST https://api.keyvalue.xyz/new/myKey

You can replace the string "myKey" with anything at your choice. In response you will receive a URL in the form

https://api.keyvalue.xyz/XXXXXXXX/myKey

that you can use to upload/download your string value.

To store the coordinates and the index of our markers we perform two steps: the array is first encoded as a JSON string, the string is uploaded with a POST to the personal URL. On the interface, we need a box containing the personale URL, and a button to trigger the store operation.

The input HTML element is located just below the title in the web page, while the "Save" button is below the map. In the program we associate a function to the click event on the button. The event takes the URL value from the input box and performs a POST request using the fetch library function. The function takes as parameters the destination URL, an a list of optional parameters. In our case we have the method name POST, and the body of the request payload. This latter consists of the coordinates array, encoded in JSON using the stringify function of the JSON class.

To operate the service, fill the URL box with your personal URL, place some markers on the map and click the save button. To check the result of the operation, you can visit your personal URL with curl, or with your browser.

If you have some JavaScript proficiency you can improve the store operation checking if the input box is non empty, and if the fetch operation performs successfully. Otherwise you can locate the elements in the html file and play with their location and style.

Now we need a way to retrieve the data from our cloud storage, the topic of the next step. Select the *Load" branch.
